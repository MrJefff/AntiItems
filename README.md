This plugin gives you the option to completely remove the need for having some items for crafting, repairing or just anything really.

## Notes
- This basically works by adding items to hidden item slots in the players inventory, so make sure you choose your items carefully.
- By default, this plugin will remove the need for having all components that are use, however i excluded blades because players would be able to craft infinite salvaged tools if these were included.
- This was originally made for my BlueprintSystem plugin, but thought i might as well include the ability to do this for every item.
- ATM, items will only be set / refreshed on player init / player respawn.

## Permissions
- `antiitems.use` - players with this will receive the benefits of this plugin.

## Planned Features
- **On-the-fly config reloading**
- **Refreshing item numbers every x amount of seconds**
